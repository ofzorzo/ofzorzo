## About me

Hello! I am Felipe, a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/). Since 2014, I have been programming with an interest in writing clean, efficient and scalable code. My preferred programming languages are Python, C++and Kotlin, but I am always open to learning new technologies and tools.

As a team player, I thrive on helping colleagues solve problems and conflicts. Furthermore, I am skilled at keeping projects on track and meeting deadlines. If you seek a passionate software engineer who excels in a team environment, I am the right fit for you!

Here you will find some of my old college projects and my newer personal projects. If you wish to get in touch, feel free to do so through [my email](mailto:felipe@ofzorzo.com) or through [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ofzorzo/)!
